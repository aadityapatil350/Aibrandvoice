## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Speed to Value
- Users should create first post in <5 minutes from signup
- Bulk generation should save 5+ hours immediately
- Demo prominently on landing page

### 2. Quality
- AI-generated content must be edit-ready (not 80% complete)
- Video quality must not look "AI-generated" (uncanny valley)
- Indian language support must be culturally sensitive

### 3. Affordability
- Free tier must be generous enough to drive 5%+ conversion
- Pro tier should cost <50% of hiring freelance creator
- Regional pricing for Tier-2/3 India (₹2,000-3,000 instead of $99)

### 4. Multi-Platform Obsession
- Users shouldn't need to manually adjust for each platform
- One-click cross-posting saves 30+ minutes per post
- Different platforms = different needs (YouTube SEO vs Instagram reach vs TikTok virality)

### 5. Creator-First Mindset
- Build what Reddit says creators want, not what seems easy to build
- Creators are price-sensitive but willing to pay if ROI is clear
- Regional language support = 3x loyalty vs English-only tool
